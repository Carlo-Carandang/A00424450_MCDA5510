# Git Hello World #

Hello, my name is Carlo Carandang, and I'm a clinical developer and physician. I have over 15 years experience as a psychiatrist, and have developed IT skills as a Python programmer. As a graduate student at SMU in Halifax (MSc in Computing & Data Analytics), I want to upskill as a data scientist with machine learning and software development.

I have a healthcare analytics startup company, and my IT team heavily leverages my clinical expertise for healthcare analytics. My team uses the Agile SDLC methodology, using the Kanban Board in Jira. As the team-lead, I struggle with my team members not performing their assigned tasks on the Kanban Board, and I end up having to finish all the unfinished tasks for the project to be completed. I would like to learn about how to motivate my team in a startup environment using Agile, for them to be more productive and complete their tasks.

My preferred email is carandangc@gmail.com.

I wish to learn more about software development, and hope to become a proficient software developer.

I am well versed in Python. I have working knowledge of R, SQL, Java, Javascript, CSS, and PHP. With regards to app development, I am familiar with the Flask framework in Python.
